            lot of net cash in the company (already after paying salaries to people with
            disabilities). </p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">Companies can diminish or even eliminate completely the obligatory payments to PFRON by
            using a multiple deduction method. This option is beneficial to companies as well as to
            persons with disabilities who want to be professionally active. Companies can pay less
            contributions or no contributions at all and give a work to persons with disabilities.
            In this case, they have a worker for free.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">Companies that employ in a given month at least 25 FTEs are obliged to employ 6% of the
            people with disabilities. When this indicator is achieved, they can apply for a
            reimbursement of the cost of employing a disabled person. However, it may not be an easy
            task to employ 6% persons with disabilities, especially when we talk about big
            companies. In such cases, these companies are obliged to pay huge amounts of money to
            PFRON. Employing a person with a disability can reduce the payment. For every person
            with a disability that is employed, an employer can deduct a specific amount of money,
            which otherwise would need to be paid as an obligatory payment</p>

        <p class="- topic/p ">Information regarding support from PFRON is widely available. Information regarding
            multiple deduction can hardly be found. What is the reason for that?</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">Companies have to employ 6% of people with disabilities to be exempted from paying
            obligatory payments to PFRON. When this ratio is achieved there is no payment to PFRON
            and the company can apply for additional payment to the remuneration of a disabled
            person. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">The problem is that it may be hard to find proper employees to fill this 6% requirement
            of employing disabled persons, especialy if we consider big companies that hire
            thousands of people. It is particularly difficult to employ people with disabilities in
            manufacturing companies. Because of their disability, the occupational physician will
            not allow them to work. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">Until then the employer has to pay obligatory payments monthly for every person with
            disability that is not employed by this company. For most of the companies these monthly
            payments became additional tax and these money are included in the budget.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">This is where a multiple deduction can become very handy both for the companies and
            people with disabilities. First of all, companies would need to find people with <xref class="- topic/xref " href="#unique_5" type="concept"><?ditaot usertext?>disabilities who have moderate or

This
            way an employer can deduct triple (7,308 PLN) or fourfold deduction (9,744 PLN) from
            PFRON payments. In the latter scenario, this means that employer will have to employ
            only one person, but he can deduct amount as if there were 4 people (1=4). The company
            that hires 1000 people instead of employing 60 people with disabilities would need to
            employ 15 people with significant degree of disability to eliminate entirely payments to
            PRFON. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">The company doesn't have to pay obligatory payments to PFRON, can they apply for
            additional payment to the remuneration of a disabled person?</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">In the above scenario they can't, because they employ 15 people instead o 60, which is
            1,5%. Even though multiple deduction counts a person as four people, the actual number
            of employed persons with disabilities is taken into account when calculating the
            employment indicator. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">It is not said, that the company can never apply for the support from PFRON. Now that
            they do not have to pay contributions to the fund and they have people with disability
            with no additional cost, they can focus on filling the remaining 4.5% gap and then

        <p class="- topic/p ">COVID-19 has changed employers' attitude towards remote work. It has been proved that
            workers' efficiency does not decline when not supervised all the time. Currently, it has
            become more acceptable that many employees may never show up at the company premises.
            These are the perfect conditions for employing people with disabilites, to whom health
            or architectural barriers could be obstacles making it implossible to work. Physical
            presence is not needed for performing jobs like an interpreter, an HR professional, a
            lawyer, a white-collar interviewer, these are all ideal jobs for telecommuters. In most
            cases, they don't need their employer to provide them with equipment to perform their
            duties as they can use their own and bill the employer a lump sum. The financial
            benefits for employers can be immense thanks to this solution.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">However, if a person with disabilities would like to work stationary, there are some
            things that need to be checked first. A notion of a person in a wheelchair as a
            stationary employee can strike a fear that the company building is not adapted to
            her/his needs. As part of the interview process, employer can conduct a tour of the
            building to check potential architectural barriers (including a toilet inspection). It
            is worth to remember that not every 'wheelchair user' needs to use an adapted toilet.
            The candidate can assess everything himself. And then there is the issue of stairs. This
            is not a problem when non-disabled men work in the company. Unfortunately, the issue
            becomes more complicated with an electric wheelchair which weight without a passenger
            can exceed 100 kg.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p "><note class="- topic/note " type="tip">Enabling people with disabilities to work remotely would give these people
                opportunities to find better job and for employers to find a qualified employee. In
                a case when an employee has a significant degree of disability and a special medical
                condition, he/she would cost nothing to an employer due to a possibility of using a
                multiple deduction. Employer wouldn't have to pay to PFRON 9744 PLN each month if he
                hired such person. Due to their condition, remote work would be perfect for them and
                for the employer, as there would be no need to prepare a workstation for a remote
                employee. </note></p>
