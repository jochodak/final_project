            who is at least 16 years old and has a disability certificate. According to the Supreme

        deduction</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p" dir="ltr">By using a multiple deduction method we can promptly reduce obligatory
            contributions to PFRON. Apart from gaining valuable employees the company will keep a
            lot of net cash in the company (already after paying salaries to people with
            disabilities). </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">Companies can diminish or even eliminate completely the obligatory payments to PFRON by
            using a multiple deduction method. This option is beneficial to companies as well as to
            persons with disabilities who want to be professionally active. Companies can pay less
            contributions or no contributions at all and give a work to persons with disabilities.
            In this case, they have a worker for free.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">Companies that employ in a given month at least 25 FTEs are obliged to employ 6% of the
            people with disabilities. When this indicator is achieved, they can apply for a
            reimbursement of the cost of employing a disabled person. However, it may not be an easy
            task to employ 6% persons with disabilities, especially when we talk about big
            companies. In such cases, these companies are obliged to pay huge amounts of money to
            PFRON. Employing a person with a disability can reduce the payment. For every person
            with a disability that is employed, an employer can deduct a specific amount of money,
            which otherwise would need to be paid as an obligatory payment</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">If the employer would hire a person with a disability, he could deduct 2,436 PLN. When a

            or 4 higher, depending on which degree of disability a person has. Let's assume that the
            employer hires a person with a significant degree of disability and a specific medical
            condition. According to PFRON rules, an employer can count this person as 4 workers for
            the purposes of the deduction (1=4)</p>

            average salary in the economy. The amount of the deduction when employing a person who
            is entitled to a fourfold deduction may reach 10,000 PLN (2,157 EUR/2,338 USD) this
            year.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">Employment of a person with a disability that has a specific medical condition and a

            monthly 9,744 PLN (4 x 2,436 PLN) to PFRON, which is equivalent of 2,104 EUR. If the
            employer compensated the employee by paying him or her a salary of 3,200 PLN gross (691
            EUR/750 USD), he would still save 63% of the amount saved on the obligatory payment to
            PFRON. The company would be in the black 73,584 PLN (15,894 EUR/ 17,243 USD) annually

        <p class="- topic/p p">Information regarding support from PFRON is widely available. Information regarding
            multiple deduction can hardly be found. What is the reason for that?</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">Companies have to employ 6% of people with disabilities to be exempted from paying
            obligatory payments to PFRON. When this ratio is achieved there is no payment to PFRON
            and the company can apply for additional payment to the remuneration of a disabled
            person. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">The problem is that it may be hard to find proper employees to fill this 6% requirement
            of employing disabled persons, especialy if we consider big companies that hire
            thousands of people. It is particularly difficult to employ people with disabilities in
            manufacturing companies. Because of their disability, the occupational physician will
            not allow them to work. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">Until then the employer has to pay obligatory payments monthly for every person with
            disability that is not employed by this company. For most of the companies these monthly
            payments became additional tax and these money are included in the budget.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">This is where a multiple deduction can become very handy both for the companies and
            people with disabilities. First of all, companies would need to find people with <a class="- topic/xref xref" href="#unique_5" type="concept" title="Degrees of disabilities and classes of disabilities">disabilities who have moderate or
                significant degree of disability</a> and this disability is caused by a <a class="- topic/xref xref" href="#unique_6" type="concept" title="The list of the specific medical conditions used for multiple deduction">specific medical condition</a>. This
            way an employer can deduct triple (7,308 PLN) or fourfold deduction (9,744 PLN) from
            PFRON payments. In the latter scenario, this means that employer will have to employ
            only one person, but he can deduct amount as if there were 4 people (1=4). The company
            that hires 1000 people instead of employing 60 people with disabilities would need to
            employ 15 people with significant degree of disability to eliminate entirely payments to
            PRFON. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">The company doesn't have to pay obligatory payments to PFRON, can they apply for
            additional payment to the remuneration of a disabled person?</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">In the above scenario they can't, because they employ 15 people instead o 60, which is
            1,5%. Even though multiple deduction counts a person as four people, the actual number
            of employed persons with disabilities is taken into account when calculating the
            employment indicator. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">It is not said, that the company can never apply for the support from PFRON. Now that
            they do not have to pay contributions to the fund and they have people with disability
            with no additional cost, they can focus on filling the remaining 4.5% gap and then
            applying for the support.</p>

        <p class="- topic/p p">COVID-19 has changed employers' attitude towards remote work. It has been proved that
            workers' efficiency does not decline when not supervised all the time. Currently, it has
            become more acceptable that many employees may never show up at the company premises.
            These are the perfect conditions for employing people with disabilites, to whom health
            or architectural barriers could be obstacles making it implossible to work. Physical
            presence is not needed for performing jobs like an interpreter, an HR professional, a
            lawyer, a white-collar interviewer, these are all ideal jobs for telecommuters. In most
            cases, they don't need their employer to provide them with equipment to perform their
            duties as they can use their own and bill the employer a lump sum. The financial
            benefits for employers can be immense thanks to this solution.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">However, if a person with disabilities would like to work stationary, there are some
            things that need to be checked first. A notion of a person in a wheelchair as a
            stationary employee can strike a fear that the company building is not adapted to
            her/his needs. As part of the interview process, employer can conduct a tour of the
            building to check potential architectural barriers (including a toilet inspection). It
            is worth to remember that not every 'wheelchair user' needs to use an adapted toilet.
            The candidate can assess everything himself. And then there is the issue of stairs. This
            is not a problem when non-disabled men work in the company. Unfortunately, the issue
            becomes more complicated with an electric wheelchair which weight without a passenger
            can exceed 100 kg.</p>

                a case when an employee has a significant degree of disability and a special medical
                condition, he/she would cost nothing to an employer due to a possibility of using a
                multiple deduction. Employer wouldn't have to pay to PFRON 9744 PLN each month if he
                hired such person. Due to their condition, remote work would be perfect for them and
                for the employer, as there would be no need to prepare a workstation for a remote
                employee. </div></div>

                further, be more specific and include an information like for example: "We also

        <p class="- topic/p p">Most of the corporations are proud of their Corporate Social Responsibility policies.
            Environmental sustainability, empowering women, language and cultural understanding,
            community investments, supporting charities, etc. These are one of the most frequent
            topics when it comes to the companies' CSR. All of them are vital and needed. They prove
            that companies care not about the revenues but also how they do business. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">It is suprising that CSR rarely mentions the need of employment of persons with
            disabilities and rarely disclose the number of employed disabled people. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">Making a disability inclusion a company policy requires a statement from the company CEO
            so that it is heard by everyone within and outside the company.</p>

            disabilities?</p>
